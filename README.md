# Online-Payments-Fraud-Detection
The prevalence of online payment fraud presents a significant challenge to individuals, businesses, and financial institutions worldwide. Fraudulent transactions lead to substantial financial losses, reputational harm, and operational disruptions. Consequently, the ability to accurately detect and prevent such activities is of critical importance. A dataset available on Kaggle offers a valuable opportunity to address this challenge by providing a diverse collection of transactional data suitable for constructing a robust detection model. Utilizing machine learning algorithms and methodologies, this project aims to develop a model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions in real time, thereby delivering actionable insights to mitigate further fraudulent activities. Beyond model development, this initiative aspires to contribute to the broader fight against online payment fraud by sharing findings and raising awareness about the issue. Through this effort, we seek to encourage others to explore and implement similar solutions, ultimately fostering a more secure and trustworthy online payment environment for all stakeholders.
